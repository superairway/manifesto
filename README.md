# The SuperHighway Manifesto
## What's SuperHighway?

SuperHighway is an Open Source initiative aiming to accelerate the implementation of drones (UAV) based applications in SmartCities.

SuperHighway abstracts the network layer (Drone Routing Platform) and the transport layer (Drone Delivery Service) enabling developers to deploy highly scalable applications without worrying about technical issues and regulatory constraints.

## Why we must code SuperHighway?

We must code SuperHighway because it creates the platform to develop new services never dreamed before, such as:

- Delivering thousand of Air Mails
- Express delivery for medical emergencies
- Flying defibrillator
- Firefighting
- Autonomous flying vehicles (yes, the flying car is here).
- Any other ideas?

### Why now?

Amazon is not doing going to do it for us.

Delivery companies aren't profitable if they don't exploit their workers.

## How SuperHighway will be available?

SuperHighway infrastructure will be deployed in SmartCities around the world as will be offered as a platform to third party companies and developers.

SuperHighway will also be available as a development kit where any developer will be able to deploy their own infrastructure.

## Where can I try SuperHighway?

SuperHighway is located in Paris, France where we are building our first prototype.  We expect our first deployment in October 2023.

Secondly, you can share this repository with your friends,

#### Help us code the future

We are creating a small team to build the core fundamentals of the platform. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.

#### Pre-order a development kit

By pre-ordering a development kit you will be helping us to pay the developers and to buy material. You are going to need to be patient, but you will receive the kit at some point or you will get your money back.
